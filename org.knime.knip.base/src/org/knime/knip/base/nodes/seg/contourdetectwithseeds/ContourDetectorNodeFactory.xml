	<shortDescription>
		Detects nearly convex structures from a 'probability
		image'. (Deprecation: Will be replaced in future release!).
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>Detects nearly convex structures from a 'probability image'
			(where pixels of high intensity are likely to be part of part
			contour).
			(Deprecation: Will be replaced in future release!).
		</intro>
		<option name="Radius">The maximum radius the objects to be detected can
			have.
		</option>
		<option name="Angles">Has impact on the precision of the contours to be
			detected. But more angles increase the runtime.
		</option>
		<option name="Line variance">The value one is usually appropriate.</option>
		<option name="Overlap">Determines how much the detected objects are
			allowed to overlap. If two objects overlap more the specified, only
			the one with the higher score will be kept.
		</option>
		<option name="Minimal score">The minimal allowed score (between 0 and 1). All
			objects below that score will be disregarded.
		</option>
		<option name="Minimal area">Objects with a smaller area will be disregarded as
			well.
		</option>
		<option name="Distance equidistant seeding points">The distance between the seeding points over the
			image. The lower the distance, the more seeding points will be used
			causing more calculations. A good choice is the half size of the
			objects to be detected.
		</option>
		<option name="Smooth contour">Smoothes the contours by removing little
			perturbations.
		</option>
