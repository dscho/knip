	<name>Image GroupBy (Deprecated)</name>
	<shortDescription>
		DREPRECATED - use "GroupBy"-node instead.
		Groups the table by the selected column(s) and
		aggregates the remaining
		columns using the selected aggregation method.
		It more over, in
		contrast to the standard "GroupBy" node, allows to
		configure image
		specific aggregation operations (see the respective
		tabs).

		<intro>
	<p>DREPRECATED - use "GroupBy"-node instead.
	</p>
			<p>
				Groups the rows of a table by the unique values in the selected
				columns.
				A row is created for each unique value group of the selected
				column(s).
				The remaining rows are aggregated by the defined method.
				The output table therefore contains one row for each existing value
				combination of the selected group column(s).
           </p>
			<p>
				To change the aggregation method of more than one column select
				all
				columns to change, open the context menu with a right mouse click
				and select the aggregation method to use.
           </p>
			<p>
				A detailed description of the available aggregation methods can be
				found on the 'Description' tab in the node dialog.
           </p>
			<p>
				If the 'Sort in memory' option is checked the complete table is
				loaded into the memory to speed up the sorting process.
            </p>

		<option name="Group settings">
			Select one or more column(s) according to which
			the group(s)
			is/are created.
        </option>
		<option name="Aggregation settings">
			Select one or more column(s) for aggregation from
			the available
			columns list. Change the aggregation method in the
			Aggregation
			column of the table. You can add the same column multiple
			times. In order to change the aggregation method of more than one
			column select all columns to change, open the context menu with a
			right mouse click and select the aggregation method to use.
			Tick the
			missing box to include missing values. This option might
			be disabled
			if the aggregation method does not support missing
			values.
        </option>
		<option name="Maximum unique values per group">
			Defines the maximum number of unique values per
			group to avoid
			problems with memory overloading. All groups with more
			unique
			values are skipped during the calculation and a missing value
			is set
			in the corresponding column, and a warning is displayed.
		</option>
		<option name="Value delimiter">
			The value delimiter used by aggregation methods
			such as concatenate.
        </option>
		<option name="Column naming">
			The name of the resulting aggregation column(s) depends on the
			selected naming schema.
			<ul>
				<li>Keep original name(s):
					Keeps the original column names.
					Note that
					you can use all aggregation columns only once with
					this column
					naming option to prevent duplicate column names.
                </li>
				<li>Aggregation method (column name):
					Uses the aggregation method
					first and appends the column name
					in brackets
                </li>
				<li>Column name (aggregation method):
					Uses the column name first and
					appends the aggregation method
					in brackets
                </li>
			</ul>
			All aggregation methods get a * appended if the missing value option
			is not ticked in the aggregation settings in order to distinguish
			between columns that considered missing values in the aggregation
			process and columns that does not.
		</option>
		<option name="Enable hiliting">
			If enabled, the hiliting of a group row will
			hilite all rows of this
			group in other views. Depending on the number
			of rows, enabling this
			feature might consume a lot of memory.
        </option>
		<option name="Process in memory">
			Process the table in the memory. Requires more
			memory but is faster
			since the table needs not to be sorted prior
			aggregation.
			The memory consumption depends on the number of unique
			groups and
			the chosen aggregation method. The row order of the input
			table is
			automatically retained.
        </option>
		<option name="Retain row order">
			Retains the original row order of the input table.
			Could result in longer execution time.
			The row order is automatically
			retained if the process in memory
			option is selected.
        </option>
		<option name="Missing">
			Missing values are considered during aggregation
			if the missing
			option is ticked for the corresponding row in the
			column
			aggregation table.
			Some aggregation methods do not support the
			changing of the missing
			option such as means.
        </option>
		<option name="Labeling Compose Options">
			If a group column is an image or labeling the
			image/labeling specifying
			the size of the result image can be
			selected. 
        </option>
