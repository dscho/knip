		<intro>Splits an image object to multiple images (i.e. resulting in
			multiple columns). Note that all images must have the same dimensions
			and dimension order. If the input images are not of the same
			dimensions, the least common size for each dimension will be used for
			the result images (i.e. the images will possibly be cropped). If you
			want to avoid that please use the "Splitter (uncropped)" node.
		</intro>
		<tab name="Options">
			<option name="Image to process">The image object to split.</option>
			<option name="Dimension selection">Select those dimensions here, which should stay
				together. I.e. for each selected subset, the non-selected dimensions
				will be split completely.</option>
		</tab>
		<tab name="Advanced">
			<option name="Advanced split settings">
				This options allows you to specify the maximum size of each
				dimension in the resulting images. If
				<b>0</b>
				the maximum dimension size is the one of the according image.
				Example: Consider a video with dimensions X=100,Y=100,T=100. If your
				settings are X=0,Y=0,T=10 your image/video will be split in 10 parts
				each
				of size X=100,Y=100,T=10. Essentially you are cutting the video
				in
				10 blocks with 10 frames in it.
