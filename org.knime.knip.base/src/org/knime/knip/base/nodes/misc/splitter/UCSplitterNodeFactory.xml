	<fullDescription>
		<intro>Splits an image object to multiple images (i.e. resulting in
			multiple columns). In contrast to the normal "Splitter"-node the
			sizes of the dimensions which remain together will not be modified.
			To split the resulting Collection-Column use the "Split Colleciton
			Column"-node. </intro>
		<tab name="Options">
			<option name="Dimension selection">Select those dimensions here, which should stay
				together. I.e. for each selected subset, the non-selected dimensions
				will be split completely.</option>
