		<intro>Generic Convolver to convolve an Image with a given convolution
			kernel (which is also an image). One possible way to create Kernels
			for your the convolution of the image is the Convolution Kernel
			Creator. Remark: All incoming kernels must have the same number of
			dimensions, else you have to use two different Convolvers (one after
			the other). </intro>
		<tab name="Options">
			<option name="Dim Selection">Select the orientation of the kernel. The number
				of select dimensions must be the same as the number of dimensions of
				the kernel. If your kernel has the same dimensionality as your input
				image, this setting has no effect).
				to </option>
			<option name="Calculate as float">If checked, the complete convolution will be
				calculated in float precision. The result will also be an float
				image.</option>
			<option name="Out of bounds strategy">
				Select the strategy to represent image values
				outside the image interval.
