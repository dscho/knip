	<name>Max Homogeneity</name>

	<shortDescription>
		This Node provides Edge-Preserving denoising via
		searching for homogeneous neighborhoods around each pixel.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>

		<intro>
			The Maximum Homogeneity Neighborhood Node lays 8 different
			areas around one Pixel and applies a measurement of homogeneity which
			is then processed in some sort of weight. Then, it calculates each
			areas mean-value and combines both mean-value and weight to the new
			pixel value, so that the most homogeneous areas take the most part in
			the new value of the pixel and areas that lay over edges are not
			taken into account. Via a parameter you can regulate the influence of
			the weights.
		</intro>

		<tab name="options">
			<option name="lambda">The Parameter to determine the influence of the
				weights via weights^lambda. For lambda = 0 the filter becomes a
				simple mean filter which filters the most noise but preserves no
				edges. For lambda -> infinity only the most homogeneous area is
				taken to get the new Pixel-Value thus Edges are most preserved but
				the denoising is not as strong.</option>
			<option name="Window Span">The Window Span parameter determines the span of
				the window in one direction. The resulting window size is given by:
				span*2+1 in each dimension. So the bigger it gets, the more noise is
				filtered out but the less details are preserved.</option>
