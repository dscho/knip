	<shortDescription>
		Applies the Sobel-Operator to the input images. Use
		signed image types (like byte, short, etc) to avoid unwanted image
		artifacts.

			Wikipedia:
			The Sobel operator is used in image processing,
			particularly within edge detection algorithms. Technically, it is a
			discrete differentiation operator, computing an approximation of the
			gradient of the image intensity function. At each point in the image,
			the result of the Sobel operator is either the corresponding gradient
			vector or the normof this vector. The Sobel operator is based on
			convolving the image with a small, separable, and integer valued
			filter in horizontal and vertical direction and is therefore
			relatively inexpensive in terms of computations. On the other hand,
			the gradient approximation which it	produces is relatively crude, in
			particular for high frequency variations in the image.
