	<name>Interactive Segmentation View</name>
	<shortDescription>
		Allows the interactive exploration of labelings using
		overlay renderes, filters and highlighting. Especially
		useful in combination with a Segment Feature node and an Interactive Table.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>This nodes allows to view segment labels rendered on top of the
			original image. You can explore
			such overlays by adjusting transparency, colors and the used renderer.
			Additionally filtering of labels
			is possible and allows in detail examination of segments. This basic
			behavior can be extended if the node
			is used in combination with an Interactive Table. Both nodes have to be
			connected to the same (Image) Segment
			Feature node and have to use identical label names. This will connect the
			highlight mechanism of both nodes and
			allows interactive highlighting across view borders.

		<tab name="Label Transformation">
			<option name="">
				This tab is only needed if the node is used in combination with an
				interactive table.
				In this case the label names have to be build from the variable blocks
				such that the
				name pattern is exactly the same as in the Interactive Table. A common
				case is $ImgName$#$Label$.
