	<shortDescription>
		Generates random images
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Generates (random) images according to the specified options.
		</intro>

		<option name="How many images shall be created?">
			Number of images which are created.
		</option>

		<option name="Img size">
			Select the sizes of the image in the various
			dimensions. The first value specifies the minimum, the second
			the maximum size. E.g. the entry 1,10 will result in images from
			(including) size 1 to 10 in the selected dimension. Setting
			both values to zero excludes a dimension. 
		</option>
		<option name="Random size in bounds">
			If selected, random images within the defined
			dimensionality will be
			generated. For example, if you select X and Y
			to be 100 each, then
			the resulting images may be of size [1;100] for X
			and Y respectively.
		</option>
		<option name="Pixel Type">
			Select the pixel type of the resulting images. If
			you select random, each
			generated image may have another PixelType.
			Please keep in mind, that the larger your PixelType (e.g. IntType
			needs more memory than ByteType) the more memory is uses.
		</option>

		<option name="Factory type">
			Select the factory type of the resulting images.
			If you select random, each
			generated image may have another factory.
		</option>

		<option name="Image content">
			Select a constant value as the value of each pixel
			or select the pixels to be set randomly according to their value
			range. (e.g. ByteType is -128 up to 127).
