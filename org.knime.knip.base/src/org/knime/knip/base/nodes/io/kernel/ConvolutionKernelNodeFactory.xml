	<shortDescription>
		Creates convolution kernels, i.e. images from certain
		functions.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>Creates convolution kernels, i.e. images from certain
			functions, which subsequently can be used for the convolution with
			other images using the Convolver-node.</intro>
		<option name="Usage">
			Add the kernels of choice from the list and
			configure them accordingly. For most parameters of the kernels
			multiple values are allowed (separated by comma), where each parameter combination results
			in a new kernel (cp. 'Variant Browser') and, hence, a new row in the result table.
