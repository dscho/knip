		Picks image peaks, i.e. local maxima.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Picks image peaks, i.e. local maxima.
			The result is that this is a fairly simple, (hopefully) fast
			peak-picker, but it is accurate
			only for strict peaks, that is, peaks that have no neighbors of equal
			value.

			This picker does no pre-processing, so it may be advisable to smooth your
			peak image before
			using this.
			<b>Deprecated: Use Maximum Finder instead.</b>
		</intro>
		<tab name="Options">
			<option name="Do suppression"> If true, the maxima in a local radius are
				suppressed, except the highest one. </option>
			<option name="Peak suppresion region radius">Sets the peak suppression region to a spheroid of
				radius r.
		</option>
