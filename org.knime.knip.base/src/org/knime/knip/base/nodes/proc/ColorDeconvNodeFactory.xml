		<intro>
			The colour deconvolution node implements stain separation using
			Ruifrok and
			Johnston's method described in
			<i>Ruifrok AC, Johnston DA. Quantification of histochemical staining
				by color deconvolution. Anal Quant Cytol Histol 23: 291-299, 2001.</i>

		<tab name="Options">
			<option name="Dim selection">Select the dimensions here. The first dimensions
				(usually X and Y) are the dimensions of the image plane, the third
				dimensions should contain the RGB-information (at most 3).</option>
			<option name="Stain selection">There are a number of "built in" stain vectors,
				but you may have to
				determine your own vectors to achieve a
				more
				accurate stain
				separation, depending on the stains and methods
				you use.
				Additionally there is the option to determine the stain vectors
				manually by specifing some regions in a source image representing the
				different colors (r,g,b), see 'Manual selection'. 
		</option>
			<option name="Manual selection">Select here the regions for the three different
				colors in a specific source image.</option>
